# Project3
Team Henri Theil

Our topic is the relationship between diet, budget, and prices in Ethiopia before and after droughts. We will investigate in-depth about the drought in Ethiopia in 2011 and its effect on nutrition and food demand. We use a difference in differences approach for the counterfactual.

Our work can be found in the following documents:
* Ethiopia_2011_2012 includes the demand and nutrition code for this project
* Ethiopia_2015_2016 includes the demand and nutrition code for this project
* Inflation_counterfactual compares Ethiopia with countries around coastal and inland Africa based on how their inflation rates have changed over time, before and after the drought
