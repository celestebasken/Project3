# Project3

Our topic is the relationship between diet, budget, and prices in Ethiopia before and after droughts. We will investigate in-depth about the drought in Ethiopia in 2011 and its effect on nutrition and food demand. We use a difference in differences approach for the counterfactual.

Collaboration: We collaborated using the following tools:

Github for code sharing and collaboration

iMessage for communication

Google docs to organize project objectives

Zoom to record our final project

Google Slides to present our final project
